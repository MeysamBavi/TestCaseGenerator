# TestCaseGenerator
A java program to generate test cases for programming problems. Websites like [quera](https://quera.ir/) can use these test cases to judge and grade solutions.  
  
It works both on windows and linux (not tested on linux yet. You can help me on that).

### How to use

Edit the properties and methods in `ProblemConfigData.java`, then compile and run `Main`.  
  
The only 'programming' you need to do here is to rewrite the `generateInput` method; your solution **doesn't** have to be written in java.
