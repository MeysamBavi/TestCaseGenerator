## Example
So here's a programming question:

> Sum the two integers in the input and print out the result.  
>   
> Input example  
> ``11 16``  
> 
> Output example  
> ``27``

The solution app that gives the correct answer is in `solution.py` python script.  
Let's assume it's stored in `C:\src\ProblemOne` path; The `ProblemOne.java` class is how you would use `TestCaseGenerator`.
